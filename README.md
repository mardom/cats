## Python dependencies

We have included a number of useful Python packages in the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/stellarstreams/cats/blob/main/requirements.txt) file — to install these, you can use `pip`:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Python 3.11 was *just* released, but not all packages have built wheels for this, so we
recommend using Python 3.9 or 3.10.
